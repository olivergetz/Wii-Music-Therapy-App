This app is being developed to help my mother who struggles with muscle control after a having a stroke. 
The purpose of the app is to gamify muscle exercises. The user is prompted with a note which they will have to match
by moving their arms up and down and squeezing a WiiMote.

Feel free to use the max patches for other developments as well.
